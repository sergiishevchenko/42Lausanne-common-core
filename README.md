# 📘 42Lausanne Common Core

A comprehensive collection of projects completed during the **Common Core program** at [42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch).

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains all the projects I completed during the **Common Core** at **42 Lausanne** — from low-level **C** programming to advanced **C++**, networking, system administration, and full-stack web development.

Each directory represents a specific milestone in the curriculum, illustrating the progression of technical complexity and new technologies introduced. The repository serves as both a learning archive and a public portfolio.
