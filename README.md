## 📋 Overview

This repository contains all projects completed as part of the **42 Lausanne Common Core** curriculum. The 42 program is a peer-to-peer learning environment focused on software engineering fundamentals, where students learn through hands-on projects without traditional lectures.

The projects progress from basic C programming fundamentals to advanced system programming, web development, and full-stack applications, covering a wide range of computer science concepts.
